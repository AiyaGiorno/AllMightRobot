# SophieBot stuff

Here placed some stuff which I used for SophieBot
Mostly all you can apply by coping file to modules dir and restarting bot

## Warning!

Make in mind, this code can be buggy, unlinted and unmaintained, I used this stuff at once and open-sourced for SophieBot community
Some of imported libs not in requirements.txt

## List of stuff

* deletegarbagefromchat_list.py - Remove garbage in chat_list collection generated by mine error in sources
* import_gbans_from_rose_fed.py - Import Gbans from Rose Fedearion fbanned list
* import_gbans_from_marie.py - Import Gbans from Marie gbanned list
* migrate_from_yana.py - Import notes from YanaBot for Migration feature (Should work with all Marie clones, but I didnt tested)
